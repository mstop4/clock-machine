> *Father–! Father–! Will ten hours never end––??!!*

Welcome, **Worker #11812**. You have been selected to regularly operate the paternoster machine during alternating 10-hour shifts. You instructions are as follows:

1. Move the hands of the dial over active lights to turn them off.
2. Don't let the lights flash, that will allow pressure to build up.
3. Don't let the pressure meter go critical, or the consequences will be dire.
4. Turning off special blue lights will relieve some of the pressure.

A game made with *Phaser 3* inspired by the clock-like "paternoster machine" from the 1927 film *[Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film))* by Fritz Lang.
